This is a website for a book that provides users with tested workflows for privacy protected federated omic data analysis in multi-center studies with [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/). All the funcionalities described on this book have been developed at the Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology (BRGE) of ISGlobal with external help from Yannick Marcon (Obiba); and are part of OmicSHIELD.

The aim of this book is to be a showcase of the capabilities of the software we developed as well as being a quick reference guide for new researchers interested in this technology.

This material also serves as an online companion for the manuscript "NOMBRE DEL PAPER QUE ESCRIBIREMOS".
